UNLV Sudo Code Challenge
========================

This repository contains problems and solutions for UNLV Sudo Code Challenge events.

Each problem has a corresponding subdirectory inside the `problems` and `solutions` top-level directories. The `problems` directory will contain the problem description, sample inputs and outputs, and any additional material to help get you started.

While the solutions are publicly available, participants are encouraged to avoid peeking at the solutions until they've solved the challenge problem.

Participants can contribute solutions back to the Code Challenge source repository by opening a Github pull request.
